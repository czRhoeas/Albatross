Albatross
=========

Java implementation of the Albatross graph sampling algorithm.

Basically just an ugly port of the C# source code.
Probably further development and refactoring to come.

Modifications of the original program:
- Additional method allowing to export a sampled graph as a Pajek file.
- Additional R scripts allowing to compare original and sampled networks,
in terms of topological properties.
